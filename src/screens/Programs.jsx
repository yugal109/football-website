                  In this technologically dominated world, kids spend most of their time watching TV/mobile phones or any electronic gadgets when they are off school. We are all educated and know about the disadvantages of these. But, many parents do not know how to utilize kid's time effectively. Involving kids in outdoor sporting activities during off- school hours will be the best option. Kids not only enjoy the sport but also make more friends, socialize learn a lot of many new things.
